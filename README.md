# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose for this project is to analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. he Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products.
We have to choose one of the 50 datasets to perform the analysis by using PySpark, Pandas, and SQL. We need to find out if there is a bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.
We'll be comparing the results from the Vine members and non Vine members to determine if there is any bias. The dateset I chose to perform the analysis is reviews on toys.

## Results
From the result below, we can see that the Vine members have the lower 5-star rating percentages than non Vine members, comparing 34.1% to 48.3%.

## Summary
From this result, we don't see any bias on Vine members when rating their products. However it might be too early to draw the conclusion since we filtered out lots of data.
